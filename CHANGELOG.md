## [Unreleased]


## [0.3.6] - 2021-03-23

  like `storage` used to point to a file in the storage path.  See issue
  [#18](https://github.com/plandes/zotsite/issues/18).


## [0.3.5] - 2021-03-16
### Changed
- Switch from travis to github workflows.
- Upgrade to [zensols.util] 1.4.1.

### Added
- Sphinx documentation, which includes API docs.
### Changed
- Upgrade to [zensols.util] 1.3.0.


## [0.3.3] - 2020-04-25
### Changed

### Removed
- Drop support for Python 3.6.

### Added
- Added icons for thesis, patents and blog posts.
- Added option to sort items in the tree navigation.


## [0.3.2] - 2020-01-03
### Added
- Compatibility with [ZotFile].  Specifically, now storage locations are used
  verbatim if 1) no `storage:` is found in the resource name and 2) if the
  resource is a file found on the OS.


## [0.3.1] - 2019-12-24
### Changed
- Fixed export error: `No such file or directory: 'resources/src'`.

### Added
- Collections filtering using regular expressions is now fully supported.
- Ability to link directly to any item in the hierarchy.
- Link button that copies the current page URL to the clipboard.
- Added [BetterBibtex] references for easy linking to the site with citation
  keys.
- HTML (i.e. snapshots) are now visible in the pane PDFs are displayed.

### Changed
- Beautification of the metadata keys in the item table view.

- Simpler command line by moving configuration to the configuration file.
- Refactored: cleaned up class structure and graph iteration OO class patterns.
- Retrofit new actioncli features.
- Move to more advanced configparser, which uses new notation (example:
  `$(HOME)s` -> `${HOME}`).

## [0.2.3] - 2018-09-08
### Added
- Feature to export collections based on an regular expression match on name.

### Changes
- Notes now have full note text with Zotero CSS, so it looks as it does in the

  `Note`.
